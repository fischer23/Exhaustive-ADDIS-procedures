# Exhaustive ADDIS procedures

This repository contains all the code used for the simulations in the paper "Exhaustive ADDIS procedures". The procedures can be found in exhaustive_procedures.R and the code that generates the plots in the Plot_XXX.R files.

In the aforementioned paper, we introduced exhaustive ADDIS procedures for online multiple testing that uniformly improve the existing ADDIS procedures by Tian & Ramdas (2021). Alls procedures control the FWER strongly under independence of the null $p$-values.
