# Exhaustive ADDIS procedures

This repository contains all the code used for the simulations and real data applications in the paper "Exhaustive ADDIS procedures". The procedures can be found in exhaustive_procedures.R. The file plot_creator.R applies the function plot_generating_function.R appropriately to create Figures 3-5 of the aforementioned paper. The real data application (Figure 6) can be reproduced by plot_real_data.R. The IMPC_data.csv file contains 5000 observations from a full dataset available on a Zenodo repository organized by Robertson et al. (2018) (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2396572). 

In the aforementioned paper, we introduced exhaustive ADDIS procedures for online multiple testing that uniformly improve the existing ADDIS procedures by Tian & Ramdas (2021). All procedures control the FWER strongly under independence of the null $p$-values.
